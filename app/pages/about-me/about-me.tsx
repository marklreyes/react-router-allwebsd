						<h2 className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-white">Why AllWebSD?</h2>
							<p className="text-white text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
									I originally made this podcast in hopes of reaching out to others within the web development field&mdash;to let you know that I'm in the trenches with you when it comes to code. I get excited host how our profession moves forward rapidly but at the same time I'd be lying if I said I've never been confused about it as well. I felt compelled to process my thoughts through audio.
							</p>
							<p className="text-white text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
								That said, over time, the podcast has evolved into a channel where professionals inside of San Diego can also share their experiences, thoughts and ideas with the world. I've been fortunate to have guests on the show who have showcased their businesses and insights with me and I'm grateful that all of this can be brought back to you.
							</p>
							<p className="text-white text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
								I hope you enjoy these segments and please feel free to provide feedback.
